This is a PowerShell script that will leverage the Symantec EDR API and close all low priority incidents. This script was designed to accomplish something the GUI could not. In the EDR web GUI, you cannot close all low priority incidents at once. It was a manual process where you could only close so many at a time. We had thousands of low priority incidents clogging the EDR database.
